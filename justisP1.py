##create larger list/inv and add smaller list to it. After that I should be done requirements

##I HAVE HORRIBLE MEMORY AND DONT REMEMBER HOW TO DO THE LARGER LIST. All i remember is outputting a specific answer of my list like [0] [0] and that would output the first answer put in for the first book in the first/only list.
